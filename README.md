<!-- Front End Due by Tuesday, April 30th -->


Feel free to modify the code to bring the project closer to our goal.




Here's what I think still needs to be done (feel free to add anything if it's missing):



- Work on the site's aesthetics (color theme, brand name, graphic identity...)

- Create a page for each game with information.

- Add JavaScript code to make the site dynamic 
(change the sign-in and login buttons to display the username and avatar/profile picture of the user upon logging in)

- Determine if the text should remain as Lorem Ipsum or if it needs to be replaced with actual content

- Modify the game titles to include (Texas, Baccarat, ...) and the benefits within the "Become a Member" section if needed.

- Add a table on the profile page allowing users to view all transactions associated with their name in the database.

- Implement a graphical interface for the administrator to modify and view the database through a PHP document after logging in as an admin.
(I thought to include this because a part like creating a table belongs to the front-end, while displaying data from the database belongs to the back-end).




!! Please test the uploaded site to ensure it works on your end, as I encountered some issues with occasional errors when navigating between pages. !!

We might need to revise the database for better accuracy in the values it contains.



<!-- Back End -->
(feel free to modify the following to bring the project closer to our goal.)


- Ensure that only logged-in individuals can open tickets.

- Connect the website to a database and allow users to log in/sign up.

- Hash the user's password before storing it in the database.

- Establish a secure method for tracking transactions and safeguarding users' credit/debit card information.

- Link the profile page and activate its functionalities.

- Manage the reception of CVs from the hiring page (maximum file size of 50MB, temporary folder for storage...).

- Consider implementing two-factor authentication by sending automated emails for account verification.

- Handle the contact us form from the help page.

- Connect the "Become a Member" section with account creation and the addition of credit/debit cards.
